# PyTest
Made this in school. Python is legit the only coding language I CAN RUN on these school chromebooks.
## why i made this
i made this bc i found out how to code in python in school during the last weeks of school with Github Codespaces. it was pretty easy too!
also discovered this because of the boot.dev site thing with how it supports github stuffs
